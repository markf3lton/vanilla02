/**
 * Database settings:
 *
 * The $databases array specifies the database connection or
 * connections that Drupal may use.  Drupal is able to connect
 * to multiple databases, including multiple types of databases,
 * during the same request.
 *
<<<<<<< HEAD
 * Each database connection is specified as an array of settings,
 * similar to the following:
 * @code
 * array(
 *   'driver' => 'mysql',
 *   'database' => 'databasename',
 *   'username' => 'username',
 *   'password' => 'password',
 *   'host' => 'localhost',
 *   'port' => 3306,
 *   'prefix' => 'myprefix_',
 *   'collation' => 'utf8_general_ci',
 * );
 * @endcode
=======
 * One example of the simplest connection array is shown below. To use the
 * sample settings, copy and uncomment the code below between the @code and
 * @endcode lines and paste it after the $databases declaration. You will need
 * to replace the database username and password and possibly the host and port
 * with the appropriate credentials for your database system.
 *
 * The next section describes how to customize the $databases array for more
 * specific needs.
 *
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = [
 *   'database' => 'databasename',
 *   'username' => 'sqlusername',
 *   'password' => 'sqlpassword',
 *   'host' => 'localhost',
 *   'port' => '3306',
 *   'driver' => 'mysql',
 *   'prefix' => '',
 *   'collation' => 'utf8mb4_general_ci',
 * ];
 * @endcode
 */
$databases = [];

/**
 * Customizing database settings.
 *
 * Many of the values of the $databases array can be customized for your
 * particular database system. Refer to the sample in the section above as a
 * starting point.
>>>>>>> 7e72eb7910eaa61a59bcbc0a67edbb7d418674db
 *
 * The "driver" property indicates what Drupal database driver the
 * connection should use.  This is usually the same as the name of the
 * database type, such as mysql or sqlite, but not always.  The other
 * properties will vary depending on the driver.  For SQLite, you must
 * specify a database file name in a directory that is writable by the
 * webserver.  For most other drivers, you must specify a
 * username, password, host, and database name.
 *
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
 * Drupal core implements drivers for mysql, pgsql, and sqlite. Other drivers
 * can be provided by contributed or custom modules. To use a contributed or
 * custom driver, the "namespace" property must be set to the namespace of the
 * driver. The code in this namespace must be autoloadable prior to connecting
 * to the database, and therefore, prior to when module root namespaces are
 * added to the autoloader. To add the driver's namespace to the autoloader,
 * set the "autoload" property to the PSR-4 base directory of the driver's
 * namespace. This is optional for projects managed with Composer if the
 * driver's namespace is in Composer's autoloader.
 *
>>>>>>> 7e72eb7910eaa61a59bcbc0a67edbb7d418674db
 * Transaction support is enabled by default for all drivers that support it,
 * including MySQL. To explicitly disable it, set the 'transactions' key to
 * FALSE.
 * Note that some configurations of MySQL, such as the MyISAM engine, don't
 * support it and will proceed silently even if enabled. If you experience
 * transaction related crashes with such configuration, set the 'transactions'
 * key to FALSE.
 *
 * For each database, you may optionally specify multiple "target" databases.
 * A target database allows Drupal to try to send certain queries to a
 * different database if it can but fall back to the default connection if not.
<<<<<<< HEAD
 * That is useful for master/slave replication, as Drupal may try to connect
 * to a slave server when appropriate and if one is not available will simply
 * fall back to the single master server.
=======
 * That is useful for primary/replica replication, as Drupal may try to connect
 * to a replica server when appropriate and if one is not available will simply
 * fall back to the single primary server (The terms primary/replica are
 * traditionally referred to as master/slave in database server documentation).
>>>>>>> 7e72eb7910eaa61a59bcbc0a67edbb7d418674db
 *
 * The general format for the $databases array is as follows:
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = $info_array;
<<<<<<< HEAD
 * $databases['default']['slave'][] = $info_array;
 * $databases['default']['slave'][] = $info_array;
=======
 * $databases['default']['replica'][] = $info_array;
 * $databases['default']['replica'][] = $info_array;
>>>>>>> 7e72eb7910eaa61a59bcbc0a67edbb7d418674db
 * $databases['extra']['default'] = $info_array;
 * @endcode
 *
 * In the above example, $info_array is an array of settings described above.
<<<<<<< HEAD
 * The first line sets a "default" database that has one master database
 * (the second level default).  The second and third lines create an array
 * of potential slave databases.  Drupal will select one at random for a given
 * request as needed.  The fourth line creates a new database with a name of
 * "extra".
 *
 * For a single database configuration, the following is sufficient:
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = array(
 *   'driver' => 'mysql',
 *   'database' => 'databasename',
 *   'username' => 'username',
 *   'password' => 'password',
 *   'host' => 'localhost',
 *   'prefix' => 'main_',
 *   'collation' => 'utf8_general_ci',
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * For handling full UTF-8 in MySQL, including multi-byte characters such as
 * emojis, Asian symbols, and mathematical symbols, you may set the collation
 * and charset to "utf8mb4" prior to running install.php:
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = array(
 *   'driver' => 'mysql',
 *   'database' => 'databasename',
 *   'username' => 'username',
 *   'password' => 'password',
 *   'host' => 'localhost',
 *   'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
 *   'collation' => 'utf8mb4_general_ci',
 * );
 * @endcode
 * When using this setting on an existing installation, ensure that all existing
 * tables have been converted to the utf8mb4 charset, for example by using the
 * utf8mb4_convert contributed project available at
 * https://www.drupal.org/project/utf8mb4_convert, so as to prevent mixing data
 * with different charsets.
 * Note this should only be used when all of the following conditions are met:
 * - In order to allow for large indexes, MySQL must be set up with the
 *   following my.cnf settings:
 *     [mysqld]
 *     innodb_large_prefix=true
 *     innodb_file_format=barracuda
 *     innodb_file_per_table=true
 *   These settings are available as of MySQL 5.5.14, and are defaults in
 *   MySQL 5.7.7 and up.
 * - The PHP MySQL driver must support the utf8mb4 charset (libmysqlclient
 *   5.5.3 and up, as well as mysqlnd 5.0.9 and up).
 * - The MySQL server must support the utf8mb4 charset (5.5.3 and up).
 *
=======
 * The first line sets a "default" database that has one primary database
 * (the second level default).  The second and third lines create an array
 * of potential replica databases.  Drupal will select one at random for a given
 * request as needed.  The fourth line creates a new database with a name of
 * "extra".
 *
>>>>>>> 7e72eb7910eaa61a59bcbc0a67edbb7d418674db
 * You can optionally set prefixes for some or all database table names
 * by using the 'prefix' setting. If a prefix is specified, the table
 * name will be prepended with its value. Be sure to use valid database
 * characters only, usually alphanumeric and underscore. If no prefixes
 * are desired, leave it as an empty string ''.
 *
 * To have all database names prefixed, set 'prefix' as a string:
 * @code
 *   'prefix' => 'main_',
 * @endcode
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
 *
 * Per-table prefixes are deprecated as of Drupal 8.2, and will be removed in
 * Drupal 9.0. After that, only a single prefix for all tables will be
 * supported.
 *
>>>>>>> 7e72eb7910eaa61a59bcbc0a67edbb7d418674db
 * To provide prefixes for specific tables, set 'prefix' as an array.
 * The array's keys are the table names and the values are the prefixes.
 * The 'default' element is mandatory and holds the prefix for any tables
 * not specified elsewhere in the array. Example:
 * @code
<<<<<<< HEAD
 *   'prefix' => array(
=======
 *   'prefix' => [
>>>>>>> 7e72eb7910eaa61a59bcbc0a67edbb7d418674db
 *     'default'   => 'main_',
 *     'users'     => 'shared_',
 *     'sessions'  => 'shared_',
 *     'role'      => 'shared_',
 *     'authmap'   => 'shared_',
<<<<<<< HEAD
 *   ),
=======
 *   ],
>>>>>>> 7e72eb7910eaa61a59bcbc0a67edbb7d418674db
 * @endcode
 * You can also use a reference to a schema/database as a prefix. This may be
 * useful if your Drupal installation exists in a schema that is not the default
 * or you want to access several databases from the same code base at the same
 * time.
 * Example:
 * @code
<<<<<<< HEAD
 *   'prefix' => array(
=======
 *   'prefix' => [
>>>>>>> 7e72eb7910eaa61a59bcbc0a67edbb7d418674db
 *     'default'   => 'main.',
 *     'users'     => 'shared.',
 *     'sessions'  => 'shared.',
 *     'role'      => 'shared.',
 *     'authmap'   => 'shared.',
<<<<<<< HEAD
 *   );
=======
 *   ];
>>>>>>> 7e72eb7910eaa61a59bcbc0a67edbb7d418674db
 * @endcode
 * NOTE: MySQL and SQLite's definition of a schema is a database.
 *
 * Advanced users can add or override initial commands to execute when
 * connecting to the database server, as well as PDO connection settings. For
 * example, to enable MySQL SELECT queries to exceed the max_join_size system
 * variable, and to reduce the database connection timeout to 5 seconds:
<<<<<<< HEAD
 *
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = array(
 *   'init_commands' => array(

/**
 * Reverse Proxy Configuration:
 *
 * Reverse proxy servers are often used to enhance the performance

 * malicious client could bypass restrictions by setting the
 * X-Forwarded-For header directly. Therefore, Drupal's proxy
 * configuration requires the IP addresses of all remote proxies to be
