INTRODUCTION
------------

The Reference value pair module combines an entity reference with a free text
value field in one new field type.

Site builders often end up using field collection or entity reference modules
when all they want to do is store a value and a reference (e.g. to a taxonomy
term).

This module bundles the two things, a reference to some entity and a value
together in one field. It can reference any entity, the value field is a simple
text field.

One typical use is storing a measurement with its unit where the units are
stored in a taxonomy (e.g 50 liter, 20 cm, 80 %).
