athenaCoordinator® Fees<br />
<strong>Order Fee ..............................$1.00 per Order, subject to periodic adjustment as set forth below</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Subscription Fee……………...$150.00 per Portal per Month*</strong><br />
*In the event Client reaches 'Platinum' status (as described in the section titled 'athenaCoordinator Core' in the athenaCoordinator Service Description) on a Review Date, the monthly Subscription Fee will be waived until the first Review Date upon which Client no longer meets the requirements for 'Platinum' status.</p>
&nbsp;

<p>As of the Effective Date, Client’s athenaCoordinator Core Order Fee is $1.00 per Order, subject to periodic adjustment as set forth below.</p>
&nbsp;

<p>Following Client’s <span class='accord-greybox'>, Athena will review Client’s Order volume from the immediately preceding six months on or around January 1 and July 1 of each calendar year (each such review date, a 'Review Date') to determine Client’s annualized Order volume, and Athena shall prospectively adjust Client’s athenaCoordinator Core Order Fee in accordance with <u>Table A</u> below. Such athenaCoordinator Core Order Fee shall be in effect until the next Review Date. Client’s first Review Date will not occur until Client has been live on the athenaCoordinator Core Services for at least 6 months. By way of example, on any Review Date, if Client has received 60,000 Orders during the prior six (6) month period preceding such Review Date, Client’s annualized Order volume will be 120,000 (60,000 x 2), and Client’s athenaCoordinator Core Order Fee shall be $0.90 per Order until the next Review Date. </span></p>

<p>(c) The Parties shall each separately maintain effective compliance programs consistent with the relevant compliance guidelines set forth by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Parties shall cooperate with each other to provide prompt, accurate, and full responses to any material inquiry or concern of either Party related to compliance and to any reasonable request by either Party for clarification, documentation, or further information concerning Client billing or Client’s provision of, or referrals related to, health services for its patients.</p>

<p>(d) Client shall not bill or claim payment in any form, directly or indirectly, from any government health care program or other third-party payer for the cost of any athenaNet Services, including, without limitation, on a government cost report.</p>

<p>(f) Client shall verify and is solely responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness of all information entered into or selected in athenaNet or the Third Party Items. The professional duty to treat the patient lies solely with Client, and use of information contained in or entered into athenaNet or provided through athenaNet Services in no way replaces or substitutes for the professional judgment or skill of Client. Client is responsible and liable for the treatment of patients as to whom Client and its personnel access or use athenaNet Services, including responsibility for personal injury or loss of life. Client represents and warrants to Athena that (i) all data it provides to Athena or that it selects in athenaNet, including, but not limited to, codes and practitioner identifiers, are accurate and in conformity with all legal requirements; (ii) its medical records appropriately support all codes that it enters, selects, or approves; (iii) it and its personnel are duly authorized to enter and access such data; and (iv) Athena is duly authorized to receive, use, and disclose such data subject to the terms of this Agreement.

Use of and access to athenaNet Services, including, but not limited to, clinical information in athenaNet, is at the sole risk and responsibility of Client, Authorized Users, and any practitioner or health care provider or facility using data provided by Athena as part of athenaNet Services. Athena will not be liable for any action or inaction of Client which may give rise to liability under the federal False Claims Act or any state version thereof.</p>

<p><strong>Section 8. Warranties and Limitations</strong>.</p>

<p>(a) Athena warrants to Client that, to Athena’s knowledge, athenaNet Functionality, when used properly and as expressly authorized by Athena, does not infringe any valid patent, registered copyright, or other registered intellectual property right under the laws of the United States, provided that Athena makes no warranty to the extent that such infringement results from (i)&nbsp;use or access of athenaNet by Client in combination with any data, software, or equipment provided by Client or any third party that could have been avoided by use or access of athenaNet without such data, software, or equipment, or (ii)&nbsp;any breach of any agreement by, or any negligent or other wrongful act or omission of, Client or any party acting on behalf of Client.</p>

<p>(b) Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party on a continuing basis through the term of this Agreement that (i) it has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) the person executing this Agreement on its behalf has the authority to bind it hereunder and that such Party’s execution of this Agreement is not in violation of such Party’s bylaws, certificate of incorporation or other comparable document; (iii) the execution of this Agreement does not constitute a material breach by such Party of any covenants or agreements by which such Party or any of its assets are bound; and (iv) neither it nor any of its personnel to its knowledge (A)&nbsp;has been convicted of any crime arising from claims or other transactions, financial relationships, or financial dealings in connection with health care, or (B)&nbsp;has been excluded from any federal or state health care program.</p>

<p>(c) Client represents, warrants, and covenants to Athena that (i) it and its Billable Providers are, and will be, duly licensed and authorized to provide and bill for the health services they render; and (ii) all athenaNet local rule requests, technical requests, or other requests, waivers, or directives by or on behalf of Client are and shall remain compliant with Applicable Law and with all applicable payer requirements.</p>

<p>(d) <strong><em>Except as expressly provided herein, Athena disclaims all representations and warranties of any kind or nature, express or implied (either in fact or by operation of law), with respect to any service or item provided hereunder. Except as expressly provided herein, Athena Property is provided 'as is.' Athena does not warrant that Athena property will be error-free or will be provided (or available) without interruption or meet Client’s business or operational needs. Client has not relied on any representations, warranties, or statements of fact not specifically included in this Agreement, and shall not assert, and shall cause its affiliates and personnel not to assert, any claim against Athena with respect to its or their reliance on any representations, warranties or statements of fact not specifically included in this Agreement.</em></strong></p>

<p>(e) No claim against Athena of any kind under any circumstances may be asserted or filed more than one year after Client knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care could know, of any circumstances, whether by act or omission, that may give rise to such claim.</p>

<p>(f) The remedy of a credit with respect to any 'Minimum Service Commitment' described in the applicable Service Description will be the sole and exclusive remedy for the acts or omissions of Athena relating to the performance of that Minimum Service Commitment. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the combined aggregate credit remedy with respect to all Minimum Service Commitments on account of any month is limited to a maximum of 20% of Client’s monthly service fee for that month.</p>

<p>(g) <strong><em>Athena’s cumulative, aggregate liability in connection with or arising in any way or in any degree from this Agreement, from athenaNet Services, or otherwise from the acts or omissions of Athena will not exceed the lesser of (i) $500,000, or (ii) the total amount paid by Client to Athena in the 12 months before such claim arose. If damages are measured by the cost of medical services provided or the dollar value of claims submitted, Athena’s liability for such damages will not exceed the service fees attributable to such services or claims. Athena will not be liable for any failure to provide services, content, or functionality with respect to any claim, statement, or transaction that Athena believes in good faith arises from, in connection with, or contains inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise improper information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Athena will not be liable for indirect, exemplary, punitive, special, incidental, or consequential damages or losses; lost profits or business opportunities; loss of data; or the cost of procurement of substitute items or services. </em></strong>Client hereby acknowledges that the remedies set forth above are reasonable and will not fail of their essential purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Section 9.
